This is the _hello-world_ article for my blog. In this article, I will show you how to integrate [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) into your blog to handle content management. I was doing some research on the best CMS to use for my blog, and I discovered Forestry from an article by [Gift Egwuenu](https://giftegwuenu.netlify.app/how-i-moved-my-blog-to-forestry-cms/). I was intrigued by the fact that it stores your content in your Git provider. Essentially, you own your content, which is great.

Forestry is a git-based content management system (CMS) for websites and web products built using [**_static site generators_**](https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/glossary/static-site-generators/ "Static Site Generators"). It provides an easy way for you to create and edit the content on your website. Among other things, it provides a WYSIWIG editor for writing. Forestry works by synchronizing content changes with a Git repository.

I built my blog with NextJS, and my posts are saved in markdown. My blog is also hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), so this article is written in that context.

## Getting Started

1. You need to create an [account](https://app.forestry.io/login). You can sign up with GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket.
2. After you create your account, you'll be taken to your dashboard. Click on "Add Site".
3. Select a static-site generator. You can also choose from a list of starters if you've not set up a git repo.
4. Select your Git provider. In order to import your site, access to your Git provider is required. Forestry supports GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and Azure DevOps
5. Choose a repository and branch. You can add multiple branches to a repo.

After granting Forestry access to your repo, you'll be taken to your site to configure the CMS sidebar.

## Managing Content

The sidebar is where you set up your content sections, configure how you store your media files, configure frontmatter, etc. You can set up folders and files that would house your content.

For example, I have a folder labelled `Blog` on my sidebar which houses my markdown files. This folder is synchronized to a folder called `posts`on my repo, where my code processes the markdown for display.

## Editor

Forestry gives you a good WYSIWYG editor for writing content. In the image below, on the left is the post's metadata, defined when I configured my frontmatter. On the right is the content body.

You can draft posts and publish when you need to.

## Front Matter

There's a dedicated section for configuring frontmatter. Frontmatter is structured metadata that you can use in your markdown files. You can add as many templates as you want. I have one for my posts and it's autogenerated for any new article I want to write.

Each template settings is saved in a `yml` file in a  `.forestry` folder in your repo. As a matter of fact, your site settings are saved in a `yml` file in the `.forestry` folder.

## Media

Forestry supports upload of images and PDFs. These files can be saved in your repo, or you can connect to a remote provider. Forestry currently supports storing your files in Cloudinary, AWS S3, and Netlify Large Media. I use Cloudinary and it was easy to setup.

## Deployment

Forestry's job is to provide a user interface to handle your content. How you deploy your content is up to you. I host my blog on Vercel, with continuous deployment set up. On Forestry, when I create or edit a post and save, it saves the changes to my repo via a git commit which triggers a build from Vercel, and then my site is deployed. Check the [docs](https://forestry.io/docs/hosting/) for hosting guides with a number of services.

## Conclusion

I have to say Forestry is an excellent content management platform. The free plan is really generous for my needs. The docs are excellent. I'm really optimistic about it and I hope it turns out great.
